== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Make me Droid? =

Make me Droid is a free online Android and IPhone application builder.

= Why should I have a mobile app for my blog? I already have a Wordpress mobile site. =

A mobile website still needs users to type your address manually in a browser. Having your own native mobile app published on the most popular platforms such as Google Play or ITunes helps increasing your visibility. Besides this, you get additional features such as sending PUSH messages to fidelize your users to your blog content.
